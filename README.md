# World of Wardrobe

### Motivations
User can see their entire wardrobe on a phone with features like:
* randomly generate what to wear for the day, week, or even month.
* keep track of whats worn, never worn or barely worn, so no item will be forgotten.
* see the items place together to form an outfit without visually digging in the closet.

### state of completion/readiness 
Sadly this app is no where near completion, even with the proposal toned down.
**Hit List**
 * take a photo or choose file of new wardrobe when click add wardrobe
 * coordinate the wardrobe ID to populate only its wardrobe items
 * set current date when user choose the item along with a worn counter
 * improve performance of the camera bitmap when populated in the list
 * make edit fragment an overlaying popup instead of a fragment
 
### No third party library nor external service yet
My pace did not make it this far. I also realize there may be a better way to get location instead of google map API, like meta data or similar.

### aesthetic/cosmetic improvement
* User can change color and font size
* the ability to choose different style theme
* 2D animation and effects like a game.

### Stretch Goals
* algorithm to match item by color and style to randomly generated outfit
* algorithm to give priority to barely worn and never worn items to be selected in random generate.
* get codes for cutting out an image background to have item nice overlay in the outfit view
* a way to automatically add item into wardrobe when user purchase an item at a store
